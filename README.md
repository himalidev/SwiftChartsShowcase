# SwiftChartsShowcase
A small SwiftUI project that demonstrates Swift Charts with copy-paste examples. It helps you learn how to build production-ready charts quickly.

A minimal SwiftUI source set that demonstrates most Swift Charts types:
- Bar, Line, Area, Point/Scatter
- Stacked Bar
- Combo (Line + Bar)
- Range/Gantt (xStart/xEnd)
- Heatmap (RectangleMark with opacity)
- Pie/Donut (SectorMark, iOS 17+)
- Interactions (selection + RuleMark)
